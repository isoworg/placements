# Atos Consulting

### Building a 'labs' model - They are moving towards having 'digital transformation' as their primary service.

So, they need a team of 50-100 fullstack devs, with BUSINESS AWARENESS and CLIENT FACING experience.

They will be predominantly node.js, Ruby and FE javascript (MVC).

Have previously worked with New Bamboo to deliver these services, but want in-house capability.

They want to build a LABS MODEL, with agile TDD teams of 2-15 ppl, working on 2-4 month MVPs. Possibly multiple projects at once, but usually side projects will be developing internal IP - i.e. building software to differentiate Atos Consulting's offering.

London office, by default, with likelihood of travel to client sites - UK only - though that is reducing. Not expected to be in the office 5 days a week.

Starting at £35k (up to £50k for the right person and background)

Looking for someone with a depth and breadth of knowledge about a sector (any sector), especially creative, financial or corporate.
